# Modern cloud apps

The Contoso Sports League Association (CSLA) is one of the largest sports franchises and is struggling to keep up with demand from their growing user base. They currently host an e-commerce website and have a backend website that supports their call center, allowing employees to view order information.

CSLA would like to modernize their websites and move to the cloud, ultimately moving away from managing infrastructure. They are interested in whether Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) will meet their needs so they can completely remove the infrastructure management overhead.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will work as a group to implement an end-to-end solution for e-commerce that is based on Azure App Services, Azure Active Directory, and Azure DevOps. You will ensure the solution is PCI compliant, and appropriate security measures are put into place for both on-premises and public access scenarios.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to deploy and configure Azure Web Apps and associated services. In addition, you will learn to configure Web Apps for authentication with Azure AD, instrument and load-test the application with App Insights, and automate back-end services using Azure Functions and Logic Apps.

### Hands-on Lab

In today's hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Logic Apps, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure.

The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.
