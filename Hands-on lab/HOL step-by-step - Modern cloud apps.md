# Modern cloud apps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Azure SQL Database and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure.

The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members working on the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.

## Overview

The Cloud Workshop: Modern Cloud Apps lab is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and scale using various components of Microsoft Azure. The lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with additional team members to more closely model a real-world experience, and to allow members to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

![A diagram that depicts the various Azure PaaS services for the solution. Azure AD Org is used for authentication to the call center app. Azure AD B2C for authentication is used for authentication to the client app. SQL Database for the backend customer data. Azure App Services for the web and API apps. Order processing includes using Functions, Logic Apps, Queues and Storage. Azure App Insights is used for telemetry capture.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image2.png "Solution Architecture Diagram")

## Exercise 2: Proof of concept deployment

Duration: 120 minutes

Contoso has asked you to create a proof of concept deployment in Microsoft Azure by deploying the web, database, and API applications for the solution as well as validating that the core functionality of the solution works. Ensure all resources use the same resource group previously created for the App Service Environment.

### Task 1: Deploy the e-commerce website, SQL Database, and storage

In this exercise, you will provision a website via the Azure **Web App + SQL** template using the Microsoft Azure Portal. You will then edit the necessary configuration files in the starter project and deploy the e-commerce website.

#### Subtask 1: Create the Web App and SQL database instance

1. Navigate to the Azure Management portal, [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com/), using a new tab or instance and login with your Azure credentials.

2. In the navigation menu to the left, select **+Create a resource** and in the Marketplace search text box, enter **Web App + SQL** and select the appropriate auto-suggestion.

    ![In the Azure Portal on the left, "+Create a resource", search box text and auto-suggestion are surrounded by red boxes.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image11.png "Azure Portal")

    >**Note**: This is only done to make the lab easier to do. In production, you do **NOT** want to open up your SQL Database to all IP Addresses this way. Instead, you will want to specify just the IP Addresses you wish to allow through the Firewall.

17. Click **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Firewall settings Save button.](media/2019-04-10-16-00-29.png "Firewall settings Save button")
